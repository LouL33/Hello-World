    <h1>The web is becoming easier to use, even easier on a mobile devices. 
      I think that the web has expanded making it easier to find solutions to any problems anyone should have. 
      The future of the web can only have one movement and that's moving forward. 
      From where the web has been from just having black pages and designs made from symbols to now where anything can be on a page is short of greatness.</h1>
